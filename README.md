## <h2>How it works</h2>
## <h3>First the user decides the size of the matrix A by entering from the keyboard the number of rows and the number of columns. After this the user inserts the size of b, column vector (known terms) and its elements. Finaly the user inserts the size of the matrix x (variables) and the script does all the calculations and prints the results.</h3>
  
<h3>You can also save the exercises as well, in .doc or .txt. You can decide if you want to do so, typing yes or no at the beginning of the script!</h3>
